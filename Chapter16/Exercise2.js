/*
The pie chart

Earlier in the chapter, we saw an example program that drew a pie chart. Modify this program so that the name of each category is shown next to the slice that represents it. Try to find a pleasing-looking way to automatically position this text, which would work for other data sets as well. You may assume that categories are no smaller than 5 percent (that is, there wonâ€™t be a bunch of tiny ones next to each other).

You might again need Math.sin and Math.cos, as described in the previous exercise.
